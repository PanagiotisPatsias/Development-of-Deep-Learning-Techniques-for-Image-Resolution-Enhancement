# Development-of-Deep-Learning-Techniques-for-Image-Resolution-Enhancement

This thesis deals with basic methodologies for improving low-resolution images to high-resolution, with the use of convolutional neural networks. There is an attempt to optimize networks in a variety of ways to achieve the best possible result. 
Two popular convolutional neural networks were implemented with the first being the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), which was subsequently used as a starting point for comparing models and the second being Residual Dense Network (RDN) in which an attempt is made to be improved. We  use Squeeze and Excitation Blocks (SE), Efficient Squeeze and Excitation Blocks (ECA) and the addition of a Channel Attention (CA) to enhance RDN. The data on which their training is based are 91-Images and DIV2K. Optimizations are mainly based on the increase of convolutional layers, modifications or even combinations of other networks with aim to deplete as many advantages as possible. 

For the comparison and general evaluation of the models the metrics used are the Peak Signal To Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
